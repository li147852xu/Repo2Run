## 🚀 News
Our paper: "Repo2Run: Automated Building Executable Environment for Code Repository at Scale" has been accepted by **NeurIPS 2025** main track as a **spotlight**!

An LLM-based build agent system that helps manage and automate build processes in containerized environments. This project provides tools for handling dependencies, resolving conflicts, and managing build configurations.

## 😊 Features

- Docker-based sandbox environment for isolated builds
- Automated dependency management and conflict resolution
- Support for Python version management
- Waiting list and conflict list management for package dependencies
- Error format handling and output collection

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Docker
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bytedance/repo2run.git
cd repo2run
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** The sample Dockerfile directory is named `build_agent/docker_templates/` (not `docker/`). A folder named `docker` next to `main.py` can shadow the PyPI package `docker` and cause `AttributeError: module 'docker' has no attribute 'from_env'`.

3. Configure LLM credentials (see **[docs/LLM_CONFIGURATION.md](docs/LLM_CONFIGURATION.md)** for all supported providers).

   **OpenAI or OpenAI-compatible** (e.g. DeepSeek — set base URL):
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
   export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.deepseek.com"   # only if not using api.openai.com
   ```

   **Anthropic (Claude):**
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
   ```

   Template without secrets: copy [.env.example](.env.example) to `.env` locally (do not commit `.env`).

## 🔧 Usage

The main entry point is through the build agent's main script. You can run it with the following arguments:

```bash
python build_agent/main.py --full_name <repository_full_name> --sha <sha> --root_path <root_path> --llm <llm_name> [--llm-provider auto|openai_compatible|anthropic]
```

Where:
- `repository_full_name`: The full name of the repository (e.g., user/repo)
- `sha`: The commit SHA
- `root_path`: The root path for the build process
- `llm_name`: The model id for your vendor (default: gpt-4o-2024-05-13)
- `llm-provider` (optional): `auto` (default) infers API from model name (`claude` → Anthropic; otherwise OpenAI-compatible). Override with `openai_compatible` / `openai` or `anthropic`. Same as env `REPO2RUN_LLM_PROVIDER`.

## 🔍 Note
💡 For example, you can use the following repository—which is relatively easy to set up—to verify whether there are any issues with running it. I have already confirmed that it can be successfully configured on several mainstream models, including GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

```
python build_agent/main.py --full_name "Benexl/FastAnime" --sha "677f4690fab4651163d0330786672cf1ba1351bf" --root_path . --llm "gpt-4o-2024-05-13"
```

DeepSeek (OpenAI-compatible) example:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-deepseek-key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.deepseek.com"
python build_agent/main.py --full_name "Benexl/FastAnime" --sha "677f4690fab4651163d0330786672cf1ba1351bf" --root_path . --llm "deepseek-chat" --llm-provider openai_compatible
```

You can use this relatively easy-to-configure repository as a baseline to evaluate whether your chosen model can effectively handle this type of task. If the entire program starts successfully, the corresponding repository contents will be saved under `utils/repo`, and an `output` folder will be created with a structure like the following:
- `inner_commands.json`
- `output_commands.json`
- `pip_list.json`
- `pipdeptree.json`
- `pipdeptree.txt`
- `sha.txt`
- `track.json`
- `track.txt`

If you successfully configure the repository, there will be the following files:
- `Dockerfile`
- `code_edit.py`
- `test.txt`

Please note: if the `output` folder does not contain trajectory files such as `track.json`, it indicates that there was an issue during execution. You can first check it yourself; if other problems arise, feel free to open a GitHub Issue.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

  - `agents/` - Agent implementations for build configuration
  - `utils/` - Utility functions and helper classes (including `llm.py`, `llm_providers.py`)
  - `docker_templates/` - Sample Dockerfiles (renamed to avoid shadowing the `docker` PyPI package when running from `build_agent/`)
  - `main.py` - Main entry point
  - `multi_main.py` - Multi-process support
- `docs/` - Extra documentation (LLM setup, PR workflow, upstream diff notes)
- `tests/` - Optional repository unit tests (`pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && python -m pytest tests/`)
- `.github/` - Pull request template

## 🙋 Q&A
We’ve collected some common issues for your reference. If you encounter something that isn’t covered or resolved, feel free to open an Issue.

### 1. The program won’t start, or you can’t proceed to the next step after downloading the repository
A: I recommend first running our suggested example to verify that your workflow can run end to end. If files like `track.json` are not generated in your `output` folder, it’s usually an environment configuration issue. Check whether Docker has started correctly.
### 2. The program runs, but the model keeps throwing errors like: “ERROR! Your reply does not contain valid block or final answer”
A: This error originates from `agents/configuration.py`, which checks whether the LLM’s reply contains a command structure wrapped in triple backticks ```. In practice, we’ve clearly specified the required output format in the prompt; at least in our tests, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet did not exhibit this issue. If you encounter it, we suggest first inspecting the LLM’s raw output (e.g., `track.json` or `track.txt`).
### 3. Docker download speed inside the container is too slow, and how to set a proxy
A: You can modify the `generate_dockerfile` function in the `Sandbox` class located at `utils/sandbox.py`. It manages the generation of the initial Dockerfile. You can add statements like `ENV http_proxy=XXX` to configure the network proxy.

## 🔧 Proposed future improvements
(we’ll work on these when time permits; PRs are very welcome)
### 1. System Prompt adaptability
  - You can modify the System Prompt in the `Configuration` class within `configuration.py`. The current prompt is tailored to GPT-4o and may not be suitable for other models (e.g., smaller models may exceed context limits).
### 2. Multi-language support (beyond Python)
  - The current version supports Python. To add other languages, the main steps are:
    - a. Modify the prompt
    - b. Add the corresponding package management tool in `tools` (see `apt_download.py` and `pip_download.py` for reference)
    - c. Change the base image
#### Reference table:
| Language | Docker base image | Installation tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | python:[version] | pip |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | node:[version] | npm |
| Java | openjdk:[version] | maven |
| Rust | rust:[version] | cargo |
| Ruby | ruby:[version] | bundler |
| R | r-base:[version] | install.packages |
| Go | golang:[version] | go get |
| PHP | php:[version] | composer |
### 3. Rethinking “successful configuration” signals
  - Currently, success is defined narrowly: all tests must be runnable (i.e., `pytest --collect-only` does not error). In practice, many repositories contain inherently failing or non-runnable tests, which blocks configuration success.
  - We think this can be improved. If you want to tailor the criteria, modify `tools/runtest.py` and `tools/poetryruntest.py`.
  - This part can be flexible, for example:
    - Stricter: require tests to pass
    - Looser: only require 80% of tests to run, or passing a specific test, etc.
